## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to style the checkbox with minimal code and markup, basically just
adding the class 'toggle' to a standard checkbox (no label or dummy elements
needed) and have the minimal JS to make it work. It came out ok I think.

### Continued development

I'll come back to this later and try to do it without JS. The spacing is a
little off in places too and looks cramped with the bigger numbers.
